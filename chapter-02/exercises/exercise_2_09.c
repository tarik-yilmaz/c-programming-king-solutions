/*
 * Chapter 2, Exercise 9 – Improving Code Readability with Spacing
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * This exercise focuses on improving the readability of an expression
 * by inserting spaces between tokens while maintaining its logical structure.
 *
 * Given statement (without spaces):
 *    answer=(3*q-p*p)/3;
 *
 * Improved statement (with spaces for readability):
 *    answer = (3 * q - p * p) / 3;
 *
 * Formatting Improvements:
 *  - Spaces added around operators (`=`, `*`, `-`, `/`) for clarity.
 *  - Parentheses remain untouched to preserve logical grouping.
 *  - This enhances readability without altering program behavior.
 *
 * ✅ **Best Practice:** Always use spaces around operators to make code easier to read.
