/*
 * Chapter 2, Project 7 â€“ Breaking Down a Dollar Amount into Bills
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 * This program asks the user to enter a U.S. dollar amount and calculates 
 * the smallest number of $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills needed to make up 
 * that amount.
 *
 * Approach:
 *  - Use integer division (`/`) to determine how many bills of each 
 *    denomination are needed.
 *  - Use the modulus operator (`%`) to find the remaining amount.
 *  - Work from largest to smallest bill denomination to minimize the total count.
 *
 * Expected Input/Output:
 * ----------------------
 * Enter a dollar amount: 93
 * $20 bills: 4
 * $10 bills: 1
 * $5 bills: 0
 * $1 bills: 3
