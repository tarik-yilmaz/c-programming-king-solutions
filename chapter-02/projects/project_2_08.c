/*
 * Chapter 2, Project 8 â€“ Loan Balance Calculation
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * This program calculates the remaining balance of a loan after 
 * three monthly payments, considering the monthly interest rate.
 *
 * Formula:
 *      New Balance = (Current Balance * (1 + Monthly Interest Rate)) - Monthly Payment
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 *  - Using `scanf()` to get user input.
 *  - Computing the monthly interest rate from an annual percentage.
 *  - Iteratively updating the loan balance over multiple payments.
 *
 * Expected Input/Output:
 * ----------------------
 * Enter amount of loan: 20000.00
 * Enter interest rate: 6.0
 * Enter monthly payment: 386.66
 *
 * Balance remaining after first payment: $19713.34
 * Balance remaining after second payment: $19425.25
 * Balance remaining after third payment: $19135.72
