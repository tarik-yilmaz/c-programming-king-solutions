/*
 * Chapter 6, Project 8 â€“ One-Month Calendar Printer
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * This program prints a one-month calendar. The user specifies the total number
 * of days in the month and the day of the week on which the month begins.
 *
 * Input:
 * -------------
 *  - Number of days in the month (e.g., 31)
 *  - Starting day of the week (1=Sun, 7=Sat; e.g., 3 means Tuesday)
 *
 * Output:
 * --------------
 *  - A formatted calendar for the month with days aligned under their corresponding weekdays.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter number of days in month: 31
 *  Enter starting day of the week (1=Sun, 7=Sat): 3
 *
 *          1   2   3   4   5
 *  6   7   8   9  10  11  12
 * 13  14  15  16  17  18  19
 * 20  21  22  23  24  25  26
 * 27  28  29  30  31
 *
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * - The program first prints leading spaces for days before the first day of the month.
 * - Then, it prints each day from 1 to total_days.
 * - After printing a day, it checks whether the current position completes a week (adjusting for the starting day)
 *   by testing if (i + week_days - 1) is divisible by 7.
 * - A newline is printed whenever a week is complete.
