/*
 * Chapter 6, Project 7 â€“ Square Table Generator
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * This program prints a table of squares for a series of numbers.
 *
 * Original Objective:
 * -------------------
 * Rearrange the square3.c program so that the for loop handles the initialization,
 * condition, and update of the variable i, without using any multiplication.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 *  - The user is prompted to enter the number of entries for the table.
 *  - The program uses a for loop to print each number (starting from 1) and its square.
 *  - The square is computed incrementally using the identity:
 *        square(i+1) = square(i) + (2*i + 1)
 *    Instead of multiplication, the program maintains an "odd" variable which is
 *    incremented by 2 in each iteration to calculate the next square.
 *
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * - The for loop initializes:
 *     i = 1, odd = 3, and square = 1.
 * - On each iteration:
 *     - The current number (i) and its square are printed.
 *     - i is incremented.
 *     - The odd variable is incremented by 2.
 *     - The next square is computed as the current square plus the current odd.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  This program prints a table of squares.
 *  Enter number of entries in table: 5
 *
 *         1         1
 *         2         4
 *         3         9
 *         4        16
 *         5        25
