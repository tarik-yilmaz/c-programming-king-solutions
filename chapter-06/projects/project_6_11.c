/*
 * Chapter 6, Project 11 â€“ Approximating e using a Series
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * The mathematical constant e can be expressed as an infinite series:
 *
 *   e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... 
 *
 * This program approximates e by computing the sum:
 *
 *   e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/n!
 *
 * where n is an integer entered by the user.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 * 1. The variable e is initialized to 1 (accounting for the first term, 1/0!).
 * 2. A loop calculates each subsequent term (1/i!) incrementally.
 * 3. The factorial is computed iteratively.
 * 4. Each term is added to e to update the approximation.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter a value for n: 5
 *  The value of e is: 2.716667
 *
 * Note:
 * -----
 * - The higher the value of n, the more accurate the approximation of e.
 * - The program prints the value of e with six decimal places.
