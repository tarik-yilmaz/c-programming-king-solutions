/*
 * Chapter 6, Project 12 â€“ Approximating e until Term < Epsilon
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * This program approximates the mathematical constant e by summing the series:
 *
 *   e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... 
 *
 * Instead of summing a fixed number of terms, the program continues adding terms
 * until the current term becomes less than a small positive number, Epsilon, entered by the user.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 *  1. The series starts with e = 1 (accounting for 1/0!).
 *  2. The program prompts the user for Epsilon, a small threshold value.
 *  3. A while loop iterates, computing each term as 1/i!.
 *  4. The loop continues until the current term is less than Epsilon.
 *  5. The final value of e is then displayed.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter an Epsilon (a small positive number): 0.000001
 *  The value of e is: 2.718282
 *
 * Note:
 * -----
 * - A higher precision (smaller Epsilon) yields a more accurate approximation of e.
