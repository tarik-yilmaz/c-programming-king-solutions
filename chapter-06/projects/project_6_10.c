/*
 * Chapter 6, Project 10 â€“ Earliest Date Finder
 * --------------------------------------------
 * This program generalizes the date comparison program so that the user can
 * enter any number of dates. The user will repeatedly enter dates (in mm/dd/yy format)
 * until entering 0/0/0, which indicates that no more dates will be entered.
 * The program then displays the earliest date entered.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 *  1. The program first prompts the user to enter a date.
 *  2. The first date is used to initialize the "earliest" date.
 *  3. The program then enters a loop, prompting the user to enter additional dates.
 *  4. The loop terminates when the user enters 0/0/0.
 *  5. During each iteration, the newly entered date is compared to the current earliest date.
 *     If the new date comes earlier, it updates the earliest date.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): 03/06/08
 *  Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): 05/17/07
 *  Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): 06/03/03
 *  Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): 0/0/0
 *  05/17/07 is the earliest date
 *
 * Note:
 * -----
 * - Dates are compared first by year, then month, then day.
 * - The dates are displayed in the format mm/dd/yy with leading zeros.
