/*
 * Chapter 6, Exercise 14 â€“ Fixing an if Statement Error
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * The following program fragment contains an error:
 *
 *   if (n % 2 == 0) ;
 *       printf("n is even\n");
 *
 * Error:
 * ------
 * - The semicolon (`;`) after the `if` statement terminates the conditional
 *   block immediately, causing the subsequent printf statement to execute 
 *   regardless of the condition.
 *
 * Fixed Code:
 * -----------
 *   if (n % 2 == 0)
 *       printf("n is even\n");
 *
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * - Removing the semicolon ensures that the printf statement is controlled by the
 *   if statement, and it will only execute when n is even.
 *
 * Example:
 * --------
 * - If n = 4, then n % 2 == 0 is true, and "n is even" is printed.
 * - If n = 5, then n % 2 == 0 is false, and nothing is printed.
