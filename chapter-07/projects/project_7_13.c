/*
 * Chapter 7, Project 13 â€“ Average Word Length Calculator
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * This program calculates the average word length for a sentence.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 *  1. The user is prompted to enter a sentence.
 *  2. The program reads the sentence character by character until a newline ('\n') is encountered.
 *  3. It counts the total number of non-space characters (considered as part of words)
 *     and the number of words by counting spaces.
 *  4. The average word length is calculated as the total number of non-space characters
 *     divided by the number of words.
 *  5. The result is displayed to one decimal place.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter a sentence: It was deja vu all over again.
 *  Average word length: 3.4
 *
 * Note:
 * -----
 * - For simplicity, punctuation is considered part of the word to which it is attached.
