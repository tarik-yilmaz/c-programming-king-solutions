/*
 * Chapter 7, Project 11 â€“ Name Formatter
 * ---------------------------------------
 * This program reads a first name and a last name entered by the user and displays
 * the last name, followed by a comma, a space, the first initial of the first name, and a period.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 *  1. The program prompts the user to enter a first and last name.
 *  2. It skips any extra spaces before the first name.
 *  3. It stores the first letter of the first name as the first initial.
 *  4. It skips the remainder of the first name.
 *  5. It skips any extra spaces between the first and last names.
 *  6. It then prints the last name character by character until a space or newline is encountered.
 *  7. Finally, it prints a comma, a space, the first initial, and a period.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter a first and last name: Lloyd Fosdick
 *  Fosdick, L.
 *
 * Note:
 * -----
 * - The program handles extra spaces before the first name, between the first and last names,
 *   and after the last name.
