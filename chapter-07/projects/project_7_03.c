/*
 * Chapter 7, Project 3 â€“ Summing a Series of double Values
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * This program is a modification of the sum2.c program from Section 7.1. It
 * sums a series of floating-point numbers (double values) entered by the user.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 * 1. The user is prompted to enter a series of numbers.
 * 2. The input terminates when the user enters 0.
 * 3. The program adds each entered number to a running total (sum).
 * 4. Finally, it prints the total sum.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  This program sums a series of floating-point numbers.
 *  Enter numbers (0 to terminate): 3.5 2.1 -1.2 0
 *  The sum is: 4.40
 *
 * Note:
 * -----
 * - The correct format specifier for double values in scanf and printf is %lf.
