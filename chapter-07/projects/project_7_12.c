/*
 * Chapter 7, Project 12 â€“ Expression Evaluator (Left-to-Right Evaluation)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This program evaluates an arithmetic expression entered by the user. The expression
 * contains floating-point operands and the operators +, -, *, and /.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * ----------------
 * - The expression is evaluated strictly from left to right, with no operator precedence.
 * - For example, the expression:
 *       1 + 2.5 * 3
 *   is evaluated as:
 *       (1 + 2.5) * 3 = 10.5
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 * 1. The program reads the first floating-point number and initializes the total.
 * 2. It then enters a loop, where it:
 *      a. Skips any white space and reads the next operator.
 *      b. Reads the next floating-point operand.
 *      c. Applies the operator to the total and the operand.
 * 3. The loop terminates when the user presses Enter (i.e., when a newline is encountered).
 * 4. Finally, the program prints the evaluated result.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter an expression: 1 + 2.5 * 3
 *  Value of expression: 10.50
