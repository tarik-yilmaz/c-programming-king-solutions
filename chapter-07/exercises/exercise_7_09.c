/*
 * Chapter 7, Exercise 9 â€“ Type of Expression
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Suppose that i and j are variables of type int. What is the type of the expression:
 *
 *      i / j + 'a'
 *
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * - The expression i / j performs integer division (since i and j are both int),
 *   resulting in an int.
 * - The character 'a' is an integer constant (its ASCII value is 97).
 * - The addition of two ints yields an int.
 *
 * Final Solution:
 * ---------------
 * The type of the expression i / j + 'a' is int.
