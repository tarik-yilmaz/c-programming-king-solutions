/*
 * Chapter 7, Exercise 7 â€“ Octal Escapes for Character Escapes
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * For each of the following character escapes, the equivalent octal escape is:
 *
 * (a) \b : Octal equivalent is \010
 * (b) \n : Octal equivalent is \012
 * (c) \r : Octal equivalent is \015
 * (d) \t : Octal equivalent is \011
 *
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * - In ASCII, each character has a unique numerical value.
 * - Octal escapes are written as \ddd, where ddd is the octal representation of the character's value.
 *
 * For example:
 * - \b (backspace) has a decimal value of 8, which is \010 in octal.
 * - \n (newline) has a decimal value of 10, which is \012 in octal.
 * - \r (carriage return) has a decimal value of 13, which is \015 in octal.
 * - \t (horizontal tab) has a decimal value of 9, which is \011 in octal.
