/*
 * Chapter 7, Exercise 8 – Hexadecimal Escapes for Character Escapes
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * For each of the following character escapes, the equivalent hexadecimal escape is:
 *
 * (a) \b: \x08
 * (b) \n: \x0A
 * (c) \r: \x0D
 * (d) \t: \x09
 *
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * - In ASCII, each character is represented by a unique numerical value.
 * - Hexadecimal escapes are written as \xhh, where hh is the hexadecimal representation
 *   of the character's value.
 * - For example, \b (backspace) has a decimal value of 8, which is \x08 in hexadecimal.
 * - Similarly, \n has a decimal value of 10 → \x0A, \r is 13 → \x0D, and \t is 9 → \x09.
