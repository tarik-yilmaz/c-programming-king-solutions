# C Programming: Exercises & Projects â€“ Solutions

ðŸ“˜ **About this Repository**  
This repository contains my **original solutions** to programming exercises inspired by the book  
*C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition)* by K. N. King.  

It serves as a **learning resource** for anyone looking to practice C programming, improve problem-solving skills,  
and gain a deeper understanding of **fundamental programming concepts**.

ðŸ“Œ **Repository Structure:**  
The repository is divided into two main sections:  
- **ðŸ“‚ Exercises:** Solutions based on chapter-wise practice problems.  
- **ðŸ“‚ Projects:** More comprehensive coding challenges that apply key concepts.  

ðŸ“Œ **How to Use This Repository:**  
- Solutions are written in **ANSI C** and can be compiled using GCC:  
  ```sh
  gcc exercise_1_1.c -o exercise_1_1
  ./exercise_1_1
  ```
- This repository is meant as a **learning resource**, where you can study and analyze the solutions.  
- **The code will remain unchanged**, as it reflects my personal solutions for future reference.  

ðŸ“Œ **Important Notes:**  
- **This repository does not include any problem statements from the book** to comply with copyright rules.  
- The solutions are **written in my own words**, and only general problem summaries are provided.  
- This repository is meant to serve as a **free learning resource**â€”you are encouraged to study and adapt the solutions to improve your coding skills.  

ðŸ“Œ **Feedback & Discussions:**  
- If you have **suggestions** or want to discuss alternative approaches, feel free to open an **issue**.  
- However, **pull requests modifying the code will not be merged**, as this repository is meant to reflect my personal solutions.
