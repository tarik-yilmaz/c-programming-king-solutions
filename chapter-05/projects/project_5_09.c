/*
 * Chapter 5, Project 9 â€“ Date Comparison
 * --------------------------------------
 * This program prompts the user to enter two dates in the format mm/dd/yy and then
 * determines which date comes earlier on the calendar.
 *
 * Input Format:
 * -------------
 *  - The user is prompted to enter two dates in the format mm/dd/yy.
 *
 * Output Format:
 * --------------
 *  - The program displays which date is earlier.
 *  - If both dates are the same, it indicates so.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter first date (mm/dd/yy): 3/6/08
 *  Enter second date (mm/dd/yy): 5/17/07
 *  05/17/07 is earlier than 03/06/08
 *
 * Notes:
 * ------
 * - The dates are compared by year first, then by month, and finally by day.
 * - If the dates are identical, the program prints a message indicating they are the same.
