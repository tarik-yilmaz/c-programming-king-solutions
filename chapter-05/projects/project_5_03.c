/*
 * Chapter 5, Project 3 â€“ Broker Commission Calculator
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * This program extends the original broker.c program by making the following changes:
 *
 * (a) The user is prompted to enter the number of shares and the price per share,
 *     instead of the overall value of the trade.
 *
 * (b) The program calculates the commission charged by a rival broker.
 *     - For fewer than 2000 shares, the rival's commission is: $33 plus 3 cents per share.
 *     - For 2000 shares or more, the rival's commission is: $33 plus 2 cents per share.
 *
 * The trade value is computed as:
 *     value = number of shares * price per share.
 *
 * The original broker's commission is determined by the trade value according
 * to a tiered formula, with a minimum commission of $39.00.
 *
 * The program then displays both the commission charged by the original broker
 * and the rival's commission.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter the number of shares: 1500
 *  Enter the price per share: 20.00
 *  Commission: $[calculated_value]
 *  Rival's commission: $[calculated_value]
 *
 * Notes:
 * ------
 * - This program uses if statements to select the correct commission rate based on
 *   the trade value.
 * - The rival broker's commission is computed based solely on the number of shares.
