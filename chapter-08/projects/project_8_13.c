/*
 * Chapter 8, Project 13 â€“ Name Formatter with Output Labeling
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * This program reads a first and last name from the user and then displays the name
 * in the format "LastName, F." where F is the first initial.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 *  1. The program reads the first name (only the first letter is needed) and then skips
 *     the rest of the first name.
 *  2. It then skips any extra spaces between the first and last names.
 *  3. The last name is read into an array of characters (up to 20 characters).
 *  4. Finally, the program prints the formatted name: "LastName, F."
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * ------------
 *  - The last name is no more than 20 characters long.
