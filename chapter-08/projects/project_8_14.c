/*
 * Chapter 8, Project 14 â€“ Reverse Sentence by Words
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * This program reads a sentence from the user and then reverses the words in the sentence.
 * The program stops reading when it encounters a terminating character ('.', '!', or '?'),
 * which is saved separately. It then prints the words in reverse order, followed by the
 * terminating character.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 *  1. Read the sentence character by character into an array until a newline or a terminating
 *     character ('.', '!', '?') is encountered. Save the terminating character separately.
 *  2. Null-terminate the array.
 *  3. Starting from the end of the array, search backward to find the beginning of each word.
 *  4. Print each word in reverse order.
 *  5. Finally, print the terminating character.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter a sentence: you can cage a swallow can't you?
 *  Reversal of sentence: you can't swallow a cage can you?
