/*
 * Chapter 8, Project 5 â€“ Monthly Compounded Interest Calculator
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 * This program modifies the interest.c program from Section 8.1 so that it compounds
 * interest monthly instead of annually. The output format remains the same; the balance
 * is still shown at annual intervals.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 * 1. The user enters a starting interest rate and the number of years.
 * 2. The program initializes an array of 5 interest rates (starting at the given rate and
 *    increasing by 1 percentage point for each element) and sets the initial balance.
 * 3. For each year, the program compounds the interest monthly (i.e., 12 times per year).
 *    - For each month, the balance is updated by multiplying by (1 + (rate/100)/12).
 * 4. After processing all 12 months for the year, the balance for each rate is printed.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter interest rate: 5
 *  Enter number of years: 3
 *
 *  Years    5%    6%    7%    8%    9%
 *    1    105.12 105.98 106.86 107.76 108.68
 *    2    110.48 111.96 113.45 115.00 116.57
 *    3    116.08 118.18 120.30 122.44 124.61
 *
 * Note:
 * -----
 * - The macro NUM_RATES computes the number of interest rates in the array.
 * - The interest is compounded monthly (12 times per year).
