/*
 * Chapter 8, Project 8 â€“ Quiz Grades Analyzer
 * -------------------------------------------
 * This program prompts the user to enter five quiz grades for each of five students.
 * It then computes:
 *   1. For each student: the total score and average score.
 *   2. For each quiz: the average score, the high score, and the low score.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 *  - A 5x5 integer array is used to store the quiz grades for 5 students.
 *  - The program first reads the quiz grades for each student.
 *  - For each student (each row), the program computes the sum and average of the grades.
 *  - Then, for each quiz (each column), it computes the sum, average, highest, and lowest scores.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Input for each student might be:
 *      Student 1: 8 3 9 0 10
 *      Student 2: 3 5 17 1 1
 *      Student 3: 2 8 6 23 1
 *      Student 4: 15 7 3 2 9
 *      Student 5: 6 14 2 6 0
 *
 *  The program then displays:
 *      Total and average scores for each student.
 *      Average, high, and low scores for each quiz.
