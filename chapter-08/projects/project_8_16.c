/*
 * Chapter 8, Project 16 â€“ Anagram Tester
 * ---------------------------------------
 * This program tests whether two words are anagrams (i.e., they are permutations
 * of the same letters). It uses an array of 26 integers to count the occurrences of
 * each letter in the alphabet.
 *
 * Process:
 * --------
 *  1. The user is prompted to enter the first word. Each letter is converted to lowercase,
 *     and the corresponding element in the count array is incremented.
 *  2. The user is then prompted to enter the second word. For each letter, the corresponding
 *     element in the count array is decremented.
 *  3. After processing both words, the program checks whether all elements in the count array
 *     are zero. If so, the words are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.
 *
 * Example Run:
 * ------------
 *  Enter first word: smartest
 *  Enter second word: mattress
 *  The words are anagrams.
 *
 *  Enter first word: dumbest
 *  Enter second word: stumble
 *  The words are not anagrams.
 *
 * Note:
 * -----
 * - Non-alphabetic characters are ignored.
 * - Upper-case letters are treated the same as lower-case letters.
 * - The program uses functions from <ctype.h> (isalpha and tolower) for input processing.
